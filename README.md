# wireframe-exercise
## Lab 08a wireframe-exercise. 
I did this lab without any student support, but followed Ryan's example almost 100%. I'm not familiar enough yet with any of the languages to go free range, I feel more comfortable learning this in baby steps. 

Seeing how Ryan thought the problem through, and then how he quickly made up the scaffolding for the page and css was both impressive and very instructive. I'm going to use the exact same wireframe for salmon cookies.
